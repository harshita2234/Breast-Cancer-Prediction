# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict breast cancer based on features of cell nuclei present in the breast cancer dataset. It is based on a guided project from Coursera.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression classifier that can accurately predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on certain features. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 569 instances of tumors, with 30 features each. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Project Structure

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

You can install these using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshita2234/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.
